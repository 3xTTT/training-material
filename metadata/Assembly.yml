title: "De novo Genome Assembly"
summary: "DNA sequence data has become an indispensable tool for Molecular Biology & Evolutionary Biology. Study in these fields now require a genome sequence to work from. We call this a 'Reference Sequence.' We need to build a reference for each species. We do this by Genome Assembly. De novo Genome Assembly is the process of reconstructing the original DNA sequence from the fragment reads alone."

    summary: "The NCBI BLAST suite has become ubiquitous in modern molecular biology and is used for small tasks such as checking capillary sequencing results of single PCR products, genome annotation or even larger scale pan-genome analyses. For early adopters of the Galaxy web-based biomedical data analysis platform, integrating BLAST into Galaxy was a natural step for sequence comparison workflows."

    summary: "The Galaxy Project offers the popular web browser-based platform Galaxy for running bioinformatics tools and constructing simple workflows. The article describes Galaxy tools and workflows which are also open source. The Galaxy framework enables the user to combine these and other tools to automate organism scale analyses as workflows, without demanding familiarity with command line tools and scripting."

    link: "http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n1/abs/nmeth.3176.html"
    summary: "The alignment of sequencing reads against a protein reference database is a major computational bottleneck in metagenomics and data-intensive evolutionary projects. DIAMOND is an open-source algorithm based on double indexing that is 20,000 times faster than BLASTX on short reads and has a similar degree of sensitivity."
