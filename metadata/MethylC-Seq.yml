    questions:
    - "What is methylation and why it cannot be recognised by a normal NGS procedure?"
    - Can a different methylation influence the expression of a gene? How?
    - Which tools you can use to analyse methylation data? 
    
    objectives:
    - Learn how to analyse methylation data
    - Get a first intuition what are common pitfalls.

    time_estimation: "3h"

    key_points:
    - The output of a methylation NGS is having a different distribution of the four bases. This is caused by the bisulfite treatment of the DNA.
    - If there is a different level of methylation in the loci of a gene this can be a hint that something is wrong.
    - "To get useful results you need: data, data and data!"
