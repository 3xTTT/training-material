# Introduction

* The Galaxy API enables developers to access Galaxy functionalities using Python scripts

* BioBlend is a Python overlay implemented to facilitate the writing of those scripts

  *  Implemented by Enis Afgane

  *  It is available on github: https://github.com/afgane/bioblend and is in the pip packages (pip install bioblend)

  *  A complete documentation is available at http://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

  *  BioBlend enables the manipulation of Galaxy entities (libraries; histories; datasets) as Python Objects

# Applications

  * On the Galaxy@Pasteur instance, we use BioBlend for several tasks and projects:

    * For Galaxy administration : the automated creation of libraries for new internal users, the groups allocation for new users,...

    * For several project : in ReGaTE, we use BioBlend to retrieve a list of installed tools on a Galaxy instance (article in review in GigaScience)

    * In MetaGenSense (in press), BioBlend is used to mime all Galaxy steps from the upload of big data to the workflow launching and the data results and transfer

# Basics on BioBlend

* To start interacting distantly with a Galaxy instance with BioBlend, you need to: 
  1. have an account on it and retrieve your **API key**
  2. Instanciate a Galaxy instance object : 
  	```python
		from bioblend import galaxy
		gi = galaxy.GalaxyInstance(url='yourGalaxyUrl', key="yourAPIkey")
	```

  3. Start playing:
     * you can upload file in your library
       ```python
     	     blabla
     
       ```
     * upload data in your current history
     
     * launch a tool distantly
     
     ...
