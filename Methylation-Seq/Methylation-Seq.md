# GALAXY WORKSHOP on DNA Methylation DATA ANALYSIS

DNA methylation is an epigentic mechanism used by higher eukaryotes and involved. Methylation of DNA is involved in eg. gene expression, X-Chromosome inactivating, imprinting, and gene silencing of germ-line specific gene and repetitive elements. CpG methylations are stably maintained and can be inherited through generations (Uhh ... reminds me on Darwin vs. Lamarck). CpG dinucleotides are often highly methylated (~60-80% in mammals). In contrast non-CpG cytosines are generally unmethylated in differentiated tissues (~0.3-3%). Methylated cytosines tend to spontaneously convert from mC to T through chemical deamination -> selection pressure -> underrepresented in the genome.
