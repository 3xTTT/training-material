# What is Galaxy?

---

[![Galaxy](../../shared/images/galaxy_logo_25percent_transparent.png)](https://galaxyproject.org/)

- **Web-based** platform for computational biomedical research
  - Developed at Penn State, Johns Hopkins and G. Washington universities with substantial outside contributions
  - **Open source** under [Academic Free License](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0)
- &gt;4400 [citations](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/)
- &gt;80 [public Galaxy servers](https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/)
  - Many more non-public
  - Both general-purpose and domain-specific

???

The Galaxy Team is composed by bioinformaticians and software engineers

---

### Core values

- Accessibility
  - Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters, run tools, workflows and parse/filter data
- Reproducibility
  - Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis
- Transparency
  - Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages and workflows - interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis

???

Accessibility: Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters and run tools and workflows.
Reproducibility: Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis.
Transparency: Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages, interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.

# User Interface

---

### Main Galaxy Interface

- Home page divided into 3 panels

[![](../images/galaxy_interface.png)](https://usegalaxy.org/)


---

### The menu

![](../images/galaxy_interface_menu.png)

- *Analyze Data* - go back to the three panels home page to select a tool or see your history
- *Workflow* - access existing workflows or create new one using the editable diagrammatic pipeline (more later)
- *Shared data* - access data libraries, histories, workflows, visualizations and pages shared with you
- *Visualization* - create new track browser and access your saved visualisations
- *Help* - links to Galaxy Biostar (Q&A), Galaxy Community Hub (Wiki), and Interactive Tours
- *User* – your preferences and saved histories, datasets, and pages

---

### Tools

- Many tools available
- Free tool store: [Galaxy Tool Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)
- Each tool is a text file describing:
  - inputs parameters, commands, and outputs
  - help, tests, citations, and dependency requirements
- Every software can be embedded
- New versions can be installed without removing old ones to ensure reproducibility


- Need a tool that’s not in Galaxy? Ask a bioinformatician!

---

### Histories

- At the heart of Galaxy’s reproducibility
- Location of all your analyses
- For each dataset, the history tracks:
  - Name, format, size, creation time, datatype-specific metadata
  - Tool id and version, inputs, parameters
  - Standard output (`stdout`) and error (`stderr`)
  - State (<span style="color: grey">grey</span>: waiting; <span style="color: yellow">yellow</span>: running; <span style="color: green">green</span>: success; <span style="color: red">red</span>: failed)
  - Hidden, deleted, purged
- Histories can be very large, you can have as many histories as you want
  - Each history should correspond to a different analysis
- History behavior is controlled by the *History options* at the top right corner of the History pane

???

Purged means permanently deleted

---

### History menu options

- Most options are self explanatory .image-25[![](../images/galaxy_interface_history_long_menu.png)]
  - If you create a new history, using *Create New*, your current history will not disappear
  - If you would like to list all of your histories, choose *Saved Histories* to list all of them in the center main pane

---

# Loading data

---

### Importing data

- Copy/paste from a file
- Upload data from a local computer
- Upload data from internet
- Upload data from database queries
  - UCSC, BioMart, ENCODE, modENCODE, Flymine etc.
- Download shared data from public libraries or shared Data libraries, Histories, Workflows, Visualizations, and Pages on https://usegalaxy.org/
- Upload data from FTP (>2GB)

---

### Data types

- Data type can be automatically detected or assigned by user
  - Edit Attributes
  - Convert Formats
- Tools only accept input datasets with the appropriate data types
- Data type is assigned by tools when output is created
- New data type can be added by the site galaxy admin


---

### Reference genomes

- Genome build specifies which genome assembly a dataset is associated with
  - e.g. mm10, hg19...
- Genome build can be automatically detected or assigned by user
- User can define their own custom genome build
- New genome assembly can be added by the site galaxy admin

# Why Galaxy?

---


### Workflows

- Can be **extracted** from a history
  - Allow to easily convert an existing history into an analysis workflow
- Can be **built manualy** by adding and configuring tools using the workflow canvas
- Can be **imported** using an existing shared workflow

---

### Why would you want to create workflows?

- **Re-run** the same analysis on different input data sets
- Change parameters before re-running a similar analysis
- Make use of the workflow job **scheduling**
  - job is submitted as soon as its inputs are ready
- Create **sub**-workflows: a workflow inside another workflow
- Share workflows for publication and with the community

---

### Data sharing

- You can share your Galaxy items - histories, workflows, visualizations, and pages - with other people in three different ways:
  - Directly using a Galaxy account's email addresses on the same instance
  - Using a web link, with anyone who knows the link
  - Using a web link and publishing it to make it accessible to everyone from the *Shared Data* menu


- Tools are shared using the free tool store: [Galaxy Tool Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)

---

### Data visualization

- Track browser called Trackster
  - To visualize genomic data in a tightly integrated way


---

### Community

- Be part of an active and friendly community
- Get support and your questions answered on [Galaxy Biostars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/)
- Access community curated documentation on [Galaxy Community Hub](https://www.galaxyproject.org/)
- Learn more about Galaxy for scientists and for developers and admins on [Galaxy Training Community](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/)
