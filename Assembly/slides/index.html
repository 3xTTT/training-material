# ***De novo* assembly**

]

.pull-left[ 

**The process of reconstructing the original DNA sequence from the fragment reads alone.**

* Instinctively like a jigsaw puzzle
 
  * Find reads which "fit together" (overlap)
  * Could be missing pieces (sequencing bias)
  * Some pieces will be dirty (sequencing errors)

# **Why is it so hard?**

]

.pull-left[
* Millions of pieces
  * Much, much shorter than the genome
  * Lots of them look similar
* Missing pieces
  * Some parts can't be sequenced easily
* Dirty Pieces
  * Lots of errors in reads

# **Assembly recipe**

* Find all overlaps between reads
  * Hmm, sounds like a lot of work..
* Build a graph
  * A picture of the read connections
* Simplify the graph
  * Sequencing errors will mess it up a lot
* Traverse the graph
  * Trace a sensible path to produce a consensus

# **A more realistic graph**

# .image-15[![](../images/nofun.png)] **What ruins the graph?** 

* Read errors
  * Introduces false edges and nodes
  
* Non haploid organisms
  * Heterozygosity causes lots of detours
  
* Repeats
  * If they are longer than the read length
  * Causes nodes to be shared, locality confusion.

# **Repeats**

.enlarge120[
# **What is a repeat?**
]

.pull-left[

#### ***A segment of DNA which occurs more than once in the genome sequence***

* Very common
  * Transposons (self replicating genes)
  * Satellites (repetitive adjacent patterns)
  * Gene duplications (paralogs)

# **Beyond contigs**
]

.pull-left[

Contig sizes are limited by:

* the length of the repeats in your genome
  * Can't change this

  
* the length (or "span") of the reads
  * Use long read technology
  * Use tricks with other technology

.enlarge120[# **Scaffolding**]

* **Paired end reads**
  * Known sequences at each end of fragment
  * Roughly known fragment length
  
* **Most ends will occur in same contig**

* **Some will occur in different contigs**
