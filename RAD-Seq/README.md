RAD-Seq data analysis
======================

RAD-Sequencing is a reduced representation library method used to obtain genomic information on a whole genome without sequencing each nucleotides. Here, we propose some materials to learn how to analyze RAD-Seq data.

# Slides

Several deck of slides are available for this topic:

- [General introduction about RAD seq data analysis](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/RAD-Seq/slides/)
- Slide deck related to the tutorials:
    - [Population genomics data analysis](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/RAD-Seq/slides/pop_genomics.html)
	- [Genetic map data analysis](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/RAD-Seq/slides/genetic_map.html)

# Tutorials

A tutorial with hands-on is available for this topic:

- [Reference-based RAD-Seq data analysis](tutorials/ref_based.md)

## Input datasets

The input datasets for the tutorials will be soon available on Zenodo.

## Galaxy instance

For these tutorials, you can use the [dedicated Docker image](docker/README.md):

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-RAD-Seq-training
```

It will launch a flavored Galaxy instance available on
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
