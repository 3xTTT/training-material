questions:
- "What are the factors that affect genome assembly?"
- "How does Genome assembly work?"
objectives:
- "Perform an optimised Velvet assembly with theh Velvet Optimiser"
- "Compare this assembly with those we did in the basic tutorial"

key_points:
- "We learned about how the choice of k-mer size will affect assembly outcomes"
- "We learned about the strategies that assemblers use to make reference genomes"
