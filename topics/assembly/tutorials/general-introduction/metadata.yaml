zenodo_link: "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.582600"
galaxy_tour: ""
hands_on: "yes"
slides: "no"
questions:
- "How do we perform a very basic genome assembly from short read data?"
objectives:
- "assemble some paired end reads using Velvet"
- "examine the output of the assembly."
time_estimation: "30 minutes"
key_points:
- "We assembled some Illumina fastq reads into contigs using a short read assembler called Velvet"
- "We showed what effect one of the key assembly parameters, the k-mer size, has on the assembly"
- "It looks as though there are some exploitable patterns in the metric data vs the k-mer size."
