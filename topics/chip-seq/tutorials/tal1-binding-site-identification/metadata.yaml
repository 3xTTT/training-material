questions:
- How is raw ChIP-seq data processed and analyzed?
- What are the binding sites of Tal1?
- Which genes are regulated by Tal1?

objectives:
- Inspect read quality with FastQC
- Perform read trimming with Trimmomatic
- Align trimmed reads with BWA
- Assess quality and reproducibility of experiments
- Identify Tal1 binding sites with MACS2
- Determine unique/common Tal1 binding sites from G1E and Megakaryocytes
- Identify unique/common Tal1 peaks occupying gene promoters
- Visually inspect Tal1 peaks with Trackster

requirements:
-

time_estimation: "3h"

key_points:
- Sophisticated analysis of ChIP-seq data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy
- Genomic dataset analyses require multiple methods of quality assessment to ensure that the data are appropriate for answering the biology question of interest.
- By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced
