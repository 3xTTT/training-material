# Introduction

2 main types of metagenomics analyses
- Amplicon or 16S rRNA/rDNA
- Whole-genome sequencing

In this tutorial, we will introduce the two types of analyses with the general principles behind and the differences

# Amplicon data

Introduction about what is amplicon data (see images on Mothur tutorial)
What can be extracted from this type of data (only taxonomy)

## Extraction of taxonomic information 

Question: Which micro-organisms are present in an environmental samples? And in which proportion? What is the structure of the community of micro-organisms?

Explaining the principle of OTU

# Whole-genome sequencing data

Difference with amplicon: whole genomes (not only 16S or 18S), more information

Why amplicon is still used?

## Extraction of taxonomic information

Same question as for the amplicon data

### Sequence sorting

After we can use similar approaches as for amplicon data

To show the few number of rRNA sequences in a WGS datasets, impact on the results

### Taxonomic analysis

And visualization?

## Extraction of functional information 

Question: Which functions are done by the micro-organisms in the environment?

# Conclusion

Conclusion about the technical key points. And then relation between the technics and the biological question to end with a global view.
