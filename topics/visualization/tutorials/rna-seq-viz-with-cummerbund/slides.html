# Why visualization?

???
Data alone does not bring any information: to carry information, data needs to be contextualized. Transcriptomic data is no exception, therefore to organize the growing body of knowledge pertaining RNA-Seq experiments and infer valuable insights, data needs to be organized, annotated, and ultimately visualized.

### Where is my data coming from?

???
- RNAs are converted into a cDNA fragments through RNA fragmentation
- sequencing adaptors (in blue) are then added to each cDNA fragment
- the cDNA sequence is obtained via NGS sequencing
- the obtained reads are subsequently aligned against a reference genome or transcriptome, and classified in-silico as exonic reads, junction reads, and poly-A reads
- these three types are then used to outline an expression profile for each gene

This is the process that will:

- reveal new genes and splice variants
- help quantifying cell-specific gene expression within the genome under study

But how is this implemented?

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

RNA-Seq data requires methods to be handled, and mathematical knowledge to be interpreted.

???
- first, reads from each condition are mapped to the reference genome using TopHat
- the resulting alignment files are given to Cufflinks, which generates a transcriptome assembly for each condition
- the two assemblies are then merged together to provides a uniform basis for calculating of gene and transcript expression in each condition
- both reads and merged assemblies are fed to Cuffdiff, to calculate expression levels via statistical significance test for the observed changes
