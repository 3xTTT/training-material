# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

RNA-Seq analysis helps researchers finding new genes and spliced variants, and provides a quantification of cell- and context- specific gene expression. Its data is however complex to handle, and requires both computer science and mathematical knowledge to be managed and interpreted.

Visualization techniques are key to overcome the complexity of RNA-Seq data, and represent valuable tools to gather information and insights.
