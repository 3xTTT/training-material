    questions:
      - How are RNA-Seq results stored?
      - Why are visualization techniques needed?
      - How to select our desired subjects for differential gene expression analysis?
    objectives:
      - Manage RNA-Seq results
      - Extract the desired subject for differential gene expression analysis
      - Visualize information
    time_estimation: "1h"
    key_points:
      - Extract informations from a SQLite CuffDiff database
      - Filter and sort results to highlight differential expressed genes of interest
      - Generate publication-ready visualizations for RNA-Seq analysis results
