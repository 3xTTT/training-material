type: "tutorial"
name: "Diploid-variant-calling"
zenodo_link: ""
galaxy_tour: ""
hands_on: "yes"
slides: "no"
questions:
- "What is the pipeline of the processes for variant calling and processing it?"
objectives:
- "Identification of the genetic variation using the variant calling"
- "Using FreeBayes calls for variants generating"
- "Quering with GEMINI"
time_estimation: "1d/3h/6h"
key_points:
- "The modern variant callers attempt to assign a reliability estimate for each genotype call. This is done using Bayes reasoning."
- "FreeBayes variant caller looks at a haplotype window"
- "After variants have been annotated and post-processed one can manupulate the data with GEMINI queries"
