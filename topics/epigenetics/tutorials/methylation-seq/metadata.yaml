galaxy_tour: ""
hands_on: "yes"
slides: "no"
edam_ontology: "topic_3173"

questions:
- "What is methylation and why it cannot be recognised by a normal NGS procedure?"
- "Can a different methylation influence the expression of a gene? How?"
- "Which tools you can use to analyse methylation data?"

objectives:
- "Learn how to analyse methylation data"
- "Get a first intuition what are common pitfalls."

time_estimation: "3h"

key_points:
- "The output of a methylation NGS is having a different distribution of the four bases. This is caused by the bisulfite treatment of the DNA."
- "If there is a different level of methylation in the loci of a gene this can be a hint that something is wrong."
- "To get useful results you need -- data, data and data!"
