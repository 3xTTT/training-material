# Introduction

In this exercise, we use RNA-seq data from the study by [Brooks et al. 2011](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/2/193.long). In this study, the Pasilla (PS) gene was depleted in *Drosophila melanogaster* by RNAi. The authors wanted to analyze the effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events.

Total RNA was isolated and used for preparing either single-end or paired-end RNA-seq libraries used for sequencing. RNA sequencing data are then available. The genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and can be used for this analysis. The effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events are then analyzed with reference based RNA-seq data analysis.

Reference based RNA-seq data analysis is ...
*add a small introduction about reference based RNA-seq data analysis*

The data is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number [GSE18508](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18508).
Here, we have 7 samples:
- 3 treated samples with Pasilla (PS) gene depletion (called "pasilla-depleted")
- 4 untreated samples (called "wt")

Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Moreover, two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment.

In this tutorial, we will analyze the data with:
