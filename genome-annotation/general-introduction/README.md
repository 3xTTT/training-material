GALAXY WORKSHOP on GENOME ANNOTATION
------------------------------------
 
Genome annotation is the process of attaching biological information to sequences.
It consists of three main steps:

 - identifying portions of the genome that do not code for proteins
 - identifying elements on the genome, a process called gene prediction, and
 - attaching biological information to these elements.
